QuickRecord is a powerful, zero-installation screen and webcam recorder that lives entirely in your browser. It solves the problem of clunky, slow-to-install software by giving you an instant recording tool right in your bookmarks bar.

It's perfect for developers reporting bugs, support teams creating tutorials, or anyone who needs to capture their screen without the hassle of a traditional application.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works (Under the Hood)

QuickRecord leverages modern browser APIs to provide a seamless experience without relying on any backend servers.

*   **`navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia`**: Used to capture the screen content.
*   **`navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia`**: Used to capture webcam and microphone streams.
*   **HTML5 `<canvas>`**: The screen and webcam video streams are drawn onto a hidden canvas in real-time to composite them into a single picture-in-picture view.
*   **`MediaRecorder API`**: This powerful API takes the stream from the canvas, encodes it into a `.webm` video file, and provides the data chunks for download.

The entire application‚ÄîHTML, CSS, and JavaScript‚Äîis Base64 encoded and embedded directly into the bookmarklet's `javascript:` URL. When clicked, it opens a new window and writes the decoded HTML to it, effectively creating a self-contained web app on the fly.
